Lesson 2. Git conflict.
    Change 2 lines in your README.md locally (on your own computer)
    Create one commit for each change:
        Select the changes you want to commit and click commit
        Add a commit message and click Commit
    Do NOT push (yet)

 Creating a new development branch.
Now that you are on the new development branch, you can start changing files. Change some files in any way you like. After you made your changes, you can commit your changes and push the changes to GitHub as explained in the previous section.
